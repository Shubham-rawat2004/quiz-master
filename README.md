QuizMaster - A Simple Java Quiz Application
Description
QuizMaster is a Java-based quiz application that allows users to log in and participate in quizzes based on different courses such as MCA, B.Tech, and MBA. The app connects to a MySQL database to authenticate users, and based on their choice of course, they can participate in quizzes covering a variety of topics.

The application supports multiple subjects within each course, including:

MCA: Java, COA (Computer Organization and Architecture)
B.Tech: Electrical Engineering, Python
MBA: Financial Accounting, Business Environment
The application provides feedback on the user's performance after completing a quiz, showing their score out of the total number of questions.

Features
User login using username and password.
Course selection based on the user's degree program.
Quiz selection based on the course chosen (e.g., Java for MCA, Electrical Engineering for B.Tech).
Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with a score tracking system.
Database integration for user authentication using MySQL.
Different quizzes for each course with predefined questions, answers, and options.
Requirements
Software
Java 8 or higher
MySQL 5.7 or higher
Database Setup
MySQL Database: Create a MySQL database called Quiz.
Users Table:
sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
Insert sample data into the users table for login functionality:
sql
Copy
INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('your_username', 'your_password');
JDBC Setup
Ensure you have the MySQL JDBC Driver in your classpath for database connectivity. You can download the JDBC driver from MySQL website.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository or download the code.
Set up your MySQL database and table as mentioned in the "Database Setup" section.
Configure database connection in the code:
Replace final String URL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD in the QuizMaster class with your MySQL credentials.
Compile the Java code:
bash
Copy
javac QuizMaster.java
Run the program:
bash
Copy
java QuizMaster
How It Works
User Login: The program prompts the user to enter their username and password. It then checks if the credentials are valid by querying the MySQL database.

Course Selection: After a successful login, the user is prompted to choose a course (MCA, B.Tech, or MBA). Each course offers different subject options, which the user can choose.

Quiz Questions: Based on the course and subject selection, a quiz with multiple-choice questions is presented. The user is asked to enter their choice for each question.

Score Calculation: After completing the quiz, the application displays the user's score out of the total number of questions.

Quiz Topics and Questions
Each quiz consists of 4 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for each subject. Below are some examples:

MCA:
Java: Questions related to Java syntax, keywords, data types, etc.
COA: Questions related to Computer Organization and Architecture concepts.
B.Tech:
Electrical Engineering: Questions about electrical circuits, power, and components.
Python: Questions about Python programming and its syntax.
MBA:
Financial Accounting: Questions about accounting principles, balance sheets, and depreciation.
Business Environment: Questions about SWOT analysis, corporate social responsibility, and business models.
Example Workflow
Run the application.
Enter username and password.
Select a course (e.g., MCA).
Select a subject within the course (e.g., Java).
Answer the quiz questions.
See your score at the end of the quiz.
Troubleshooting
Database Connection Issues: Ensure that MySQL is running and that the database credentials are correct.
JDBC Driver Missing: Ensure that the MySQL JDBC driver is correctly added to your classpath.
